CONCLUSIONS OF INITIALIZATION ORDER TEST:

1. objects are created from the beginning of inheritance: parent -> child -> grandchild (initialized object) - each constructor are ran.
2. primitive types are initialized in a class with the object, but object fields are null if not initialized.
3. if toString() is overrode in all classes in chain of inheritance, only the last implementation will appear, but it'll be repeated for all classes in the chain.
Additionally last class' fields will be initialized with their proper values only in last initialization,
but previous' classes' fields are initialized in the background and accessible through "super" keyword.
